## Mint

A mint is what creates new tokens, and this is used for both fungible and non fungible tokens. Creating these new tokens is also referred to as minting. In Solana, the `mint_authority` is able to interact with the Mint. If a token has not been minted, it is not on the blockchain. Therefore, any NFTs that haven't been minted do not exist on the Solana blockchain. More information about a Mint is available on the [Solana Docs](https://spl.solana.com/token#creating-a-new-token-type).
